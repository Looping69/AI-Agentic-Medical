# LENY-AI Medical Application Bug Tracking

## Routing Issues

1. Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context
   - This is a warning rather than an error
   - Occurs when multiple Supabase client instances are created
   - Should be fixed by ensuring only one client instance is used

2. No routes matched location "/"
   - Routes in App.tsx are not properly configured
   - Home route is not being matched
   - Check AppRoutes component in App.tsx

3. No routes matched location "/login"
   - Login route is not being matched
   - Check AppRoutes component in App.tsx

4. No routes matched location "/signup"
   - Signup route is not being matched
   - Check AppRoutes component in App.tsx

## Authentication Issues

1. Possible issue with AuthProvider nesting
   - Error stack shows AuthProvider appears twice in component stack
   - May be causing authentication context conflicts

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix routing configuration in App.tsx
   - Fixed the useRoutes call by wrapping it in a proper if statement
   - Added SimpleAuthProvider and SimpleAuthCheck components

2. ✅ Ensure only one Supabase client instance is created
   - Fixed import paths to use consistent auth context

3. ✅ Check for duplicate AuthProvider components
   - Properly nested SimpleAuthProvider and AuthProvider
   - Ensured proper component hierarchy

4. ✅ Verify import paths for all components
   - Updated import paths to use @/ prefix for consistency
   - Fixed paths in DashboardHeader and DashboardSidebar

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Added admin authentication system with username "klaasvaakie" and password "Leatherman@24"
2. ✅ Added skip option for authentication
3. ✅ Added admin mode indicators in the UI
4. ✅ Fixed routing issues by properly configuring the router
5. ✅ Added logout functionality that clears both auth systems
